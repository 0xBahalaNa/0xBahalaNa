# Hey, I'm Luigi (0xBahalaNa), it's nice to meet you! 🤝

## 🧠 About Me
- I'm a technologist focused on **building scalable solutions**.
- I build practical security tools that help teams go **from manual processes → engineering workflows**.
- I believe auditing, governance, risk, and compliance should **scale with code, not checkboxes**.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- **GRC Engineering** - building automation tools for audit and GRC workflows. 
- **Identity Engineering (IAM/IGA)** - automations for IAM and IGA workflows.
- **Cloud Security** -  building and researching cloud security practices and tools.
- **Risk Assessments** - evaluating and prioritizing security risks in engineering workflows.
