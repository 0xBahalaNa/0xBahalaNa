# Hey, I'm Luigi (0xBahalaNa) 🤝

## About Me

I work at the intersection of **compliance engineering and public safety technology**. My background spans Identity Governance and Administration (privileged access monitoring, user access reviews, RBAC analysis) in regulated financial environments and hands-on technical support in a **FedRAMP High** environment serving federal and state/local law enforcement agencies.

I build tools that automate audit evidence collection and compliance workflows in AWS - replacing manual checkbox processes with repeatable, scriptable, auditor-ready outputs.

**Frameworks I work with:** CJIS Security Policy · FedRAMP (High baseline) · NIST 800-53

**Certifications:** SSCP · CySA+ · PenTest+ · Security+ · Network+ · A+ · Project+ · ITIL 4 Foundations · Linux LPI Essentials

## What I'm Working On

- **GRC Engineering** - automating audit evidence collection and compliance workflows, mapping tools to CJIS Security Policy, FedRAMP, and NIST 800-53 controls
- **Identity Engineering (IAM/IGA)** - streamlining access reviews and provisioning pipelines, applying AC-family control requirements to real infrastructure
- **Cloud Security** - building and researching AWS security tooling aligned to compliance baselines
